# CS-336-Principles-of-Into-and-Data-Management

These are some of the projects I did while taking Principles of Info and Data Management (CS 336) my fall semester during my junior year at Rutgers University. The project is completed using MySQL, CSS, HTML, PhP, and JS.

Description of the project:

  1. Bar Beer Website Application
      - A full front and back end that is primarily used to store and retrieve information about bars, operating times, servable beers, menu prices, bills and transactions.
      - Allows users to view graphical representations of different data distributions such as busiest periods of the day, and lets
        them retrieve and modify such information in the database using the websiteâ€™s graphical interface.
